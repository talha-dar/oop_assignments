* Book: OOP in C++ by Robert Lafore, 4th Edition.
* Inheritance
*** Base Class
- Original class with atomic atributes.
*** Derived Class
- Subclass of Base class, inherits some attributes also has some of it's own.
* Functions
*** inline return_type identifier(args)
- 'inline' replaces function calls with function code. Jump to function definition is no longer required, saving time.
*** Default Arguments
- given in either function declaration or definition. Missing args cannot be between provided args.
*** functions as l-value
- if a function returns a reference, it can be used in place of a l-value. It will the be treated as a variable at returned reference.
- Cannot return reference to a local variable however.
* 'Static'
- Stuff prefixed with 'static' comes into existence when their body is called, has automatic local scope and global lifetime.
*** Class Static Attribute
- declared as usual.
- Must be initialized like a global variable using scope resolution operator.
- Consider attribut ~ static int a ~ of class Test
- Initialize as Test::a=0; // anywhere in the file
* Const
*** Const member functions
- cannot modify an obj's stuff
- declared as: void func() const {//body}
*** Const member function args
- stuff passed by reference is prefixed with 'const' in decl and def so it cannot be changed. 
*** const Objects
- Const Objects are nonmutable and only take const methods.
* OOP(Important shit only)
** Default copy ctor
- Initializes l-object with r-obj
**** Unnamed temp object
- We can say 'return objType(attribute1, attribute2, attribute);' 
- this will create a temp instance of class objType and return a copy
** Operator Overloading
- Every operator has a 'this' object that is the l-value
- Every such operator can access it's 'this' obj fully.
*** Unary
Act on one operand, i.e ++,-- etc.
**** Prefix
- ++a, --b
- definition :: RETURN_TYPE operator ++ (void);
**** Postfix
- a++, b--
- definition :: RETURN_TYPE operator ++ (int); // here 'int' tells compiler that this is a postfix op, one of several such indicators in c
*** Binary
- Take two operands. i.e, a+b, a-b // where a and b are operands
- In such operands, l-obj is the 'this' and r-obj is the argument to this operator method.
